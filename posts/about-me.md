**I was born in 1980, I am 40 years old.** <br>
I grew up in **Los Polvorines, Bs. As. Argentina.**<br>
I studied at the **'EET N3 Japon de San Miguel'** and in 1999 I graduated with the title of **'Master Master of Works'.**<br>
That same year, one of the biggest economic crises in Argentina broke out. It was very difficult to get a job and I also made the bad decision of not continuing with my university studies.
I had many different jobs, I was always learning a new trade to the point that I got tired and quit.
I was a traveling salesman, construction worker, mail delivery, refrigeration technician, installer and technical service of AA.CC., I also worked a lot of time as a motorcycle cade, which gave me enough time to study and take courses.<br>
In **2016** I was interested and began to study automotive electronics, I took a course and also collected information from the internet to learn more.<br> In **2018** I was prepared to open my own workshop, but once again a new economic crisis prevented me, a large devaluation and a rise in service rates that made it impossible for me to open the workshop.<br>
This made me dedicate myself to continue studying and deepening in electronics, I began to study electronics with the idea of ​​repairing car ECUs, this was a process that helped me open my mind.<br>
In August of this year, my older brother suggested that I study programming, which I agree to. I start a new project first with **HTML, CSS, Java Script**. We carry out back end work, we add new functions, unit tests to practically all services, we migrate several services that used callbacks to promises. Then we started with **React** and this learning process is still here.
